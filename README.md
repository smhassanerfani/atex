# ATeX - [ATLANTIS](https://github.com/smhassanerfani/atlantis) TeXture Dataset
This is the respository for the ATex Dataset.

## Overview
A benchmark for image textures analysis of water in different waterbodies.

## Dataset Statistics
The current version of this dataset contains:
* Polygon annotations with attributes, annotation times, and foreground/background ordering
* A total of **1,351** annotated images
* **34** labels
* Number of distinct water bodies

|Labels|Description|
|---|---|
|Estuary|A partially enclosed waterbody that is always near the coastline, except for "freshwater estuaries...created when a river flows into a freshwater lake" (National Geographic Society, 2012)|
|River Delta|Occurs as a “wetland that forms as rivers empty their water and sediment into another body of water, such as an ocean, lake, or another river,” and may “also empty into land,” though this is rare (National Geographic Society, 2013)|
|Pool|Pools are often enclosed with a smooth, well defined borders, contain still or splashing water, and are clear from treatment|
|Hot Spring|"Forms when water deep below the Earth’s surface is heated by rocks or other means, and rises to the Earth’s surface"(World of Phenomena, 2020)|
|Glacier|"Ice masses that move under their own weight, and currently cover ~ 10% of the land surface of the Earth” (Copland, 2020)|
|Waterfall|Also known as cascades, are notable for being “a river or other body of water’s steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below,” where the plunge pool is just a landing spot forthe cascading water (National Geographic Society, 2012)|
|Lake|Relatively calm or still water with little to no blurring of reflections of the surrounding vegetation,terrain, or sky, and the waterbody being either opaque or transparent while also being generally clear of most surface vegetation that is common in other waterbodies like wetlands|
|Wetland|“an area of land... either covered by water or saturated with water,” is “neither totally dry land nor totally underwear; they have characteristics of both” (National Geographic Society, 2012)|
|Rapids|Turbulence of water and the white foam created by this turbulence, the water appearing to be moving quite quickly, and other areas close to these ‘rapids’ that appear more still|
|Flood|The submergence of land not usually covered by water and where “stream flow is characteristically turbulent”(Nelson, 2016)|
|Reservoir|A manmade lake that is created when a dam is built on a river.|
|Swamp| “Areas of land permanently saturated, or filled, with water. Many swamps are even covered by water. There are two main types of swamps: freshwater swamps and saltwater swamps"(National Geographic Society)|
